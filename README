Downstream will be a multiplayer game centred around hacking. I'm writing it
to teach myself network programming. Actual design of the game to come at a
later stage.

I will be reusing some code from the Sequtus (https://github.com/Teifion/sequtus)
project and will hopefully be able to add some improvements to it though the
engine itself will not be for an RTS.

Dependancies:
    Python 2.7
    PyGame

Run as:
    python main.py
