This project has been put on (probably permanent hold) as in theory it was
going to be very interesting but in practice would have been very boring.
As this completely defeats the point of a game I canned it but I'm leaving
the code up as it could be useful to someone else.

---

Downstream will be a multiplayer game centred around hacking. I'm writing it
to teach myself network programming. Actual design of the game to come at a
later stage.

I will be reusing some code from the Sequtus (https://github.com/Teifion/sequtus)
project and will hopefully be able to add some improvements to it though the
engine itself will not be for an RTS.

Dependancies:
    Python 2.7
    PyGame

Run as:
    python main.py
